Run this program via the command "python3 keith_data_intern_project.py" in Mac Terminal. 

You will first be asked to enter the filepath of an image OR simply pressing "enter" automatically performs a search of your current directory for all images of file type .bmp, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, or .tiff. 

If appropriate image(s) are found, you will be then be asked to enter keywords about the image(s).

The other menu options allow you to search the images by keyword(s) or feature(s), or enter "q" to quit.

The program has been designed in a way that allows for several features and improvements. Notably, images features can be both recognized and searched via machine learning algorithms in the future.
